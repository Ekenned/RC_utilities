# RC_utilities
Utilities for RC project. This may end up encompassing more then trufflebot.

'Classify_sing_features.py' is a script to read in time series features and perform single feature classification of EtOH and Acetone

The example data (chem_ts_feat.mat) used by the classifier is in the folder ...\RC_utilities\Compare_TS_feats\example_feat_data

This dataset is  comprised of labels (1-24) and time series features (6x219) gathered from different patterns (24) and chemicals (2)

'Compare_TS_feats' folder will deal with scripts for comparing time series features across chemical, for identification.

Another folder will deal with time series feature extraction eventually.
